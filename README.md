# XOP-Neutron-Scattering
XOP for Igor Pro adding functions useful for neutron scattering users, especially for polarised beams.

These functions are related with reciprocal lattice calculations, count rates calculations, peak centering calculations, optimizations, flipping ratios and asymmetries calculations and 3He spin filter calculations.
